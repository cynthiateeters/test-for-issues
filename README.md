# Week 1: Poetry Interpretation Page - Assignment Template

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment** (you'll get your own copy of this repo)
2. **Clone your repository** to your local machine
3. **Create an issue titled "Initialize Specs"** - this will auto-generate all your requirements
4. **Check the Issues tab** to see all your specification requirements
5. **Work through each specification**, checking boxes as you complete requirements

## üìã How Grading Works

This assignment uses **Specifications Grading**:
- Each issue is PASS/FAIL - no partial credit
- Complete ALL Core Specs (issues 1-4) for a C
- Add Advanced Specs for B/A consideration
- You can revise and resubmit if requirements aren't met

## üè∑Ô∏è Using Labels

Update issue labels to communicate your progress:
- `status:todo` - Haven't started yet
- `status:in-progress` - Currently working on it  
- `status:ready-for-review` - Ready for instructor review
- `status:changes-requested` - Needs revision based on feedback
- `status:complete` - Passed the specification!

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start with Core Spec #1** - Set up your tooling first
2. **Commit frequently** - Show your process through Git history
3. **Document your AI use** - Be transparent in prompt-log.md
4. **Ask for help** - Use the `help-needed` label if stuck
5. **Check requirements carefully** - Each checkbox must be completed

## ü§ù AI Collaboration

This course celebrates AI use! For each specification:
- Document prompts used in `prompt-log.md`
- Note what you modified from AI suggestions
- Explain your learning process
